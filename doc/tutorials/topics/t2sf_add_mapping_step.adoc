= Add a data mapping step

Add a data mapping step that correlates Twitter mention fields to 
Salesforce contact fields:

. In the left pane, hover over the plus sign between the filter
step and the finish connection to display a pop-up in which
you click *Add a Step*.
. Click *Data Mapper* and wait a few moments for the data fields
to appear.
. Map the Twitter `name` field to the Salesforce
`FirstName` and `LastName` fields:
.. In the *Sources* panel, click the magnifying 
glass image:images/magnifying-glass.png[title="Magnifying Glass"]
to display the search field and enter `*name*`. 
.. Under the `user` folder, click the `name` field.
.. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Action*, click 
the down caret and select *Separate*. 
.. Below that, under *Targets*, highlight *`[None]`* and start to type
`*FirstName*`. When *FirstName* appears below the field, click it.
The data mapper displays a line from the Twitter *name* field to the
Salesforce *FirstName* field. 
.. In the lower right, click *Add Target*. 
.. In the new target, highlight *`[None]`* and start to type
`*LastName*`. When *LastName* appears below the field, click it. 
The data mapper displays another line from the Twitter
*name* field, but this time it goes to the Salesforce *LastName* field. 
Blue lines indicates the current focus. 
. Map the Twitter `screenName` field to the Salesforce
`Title` field:
.. In the Twitter source fields, 
scroll down to click 
the *screenName* field. 
.. On the right, at the top of the list of target fields in Salesforce,
click the magnifying 
glass image:images/magnifying-glass.png[title="Magnifying Glass"]
to display the search field and enter `*Title*`. 
.. Click the *Title* field. The data mapper displays a line 
from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field. 
. Map the Twitter `text` field to the Salesforce
`Description` field:
.. In the *Sources* search field, enter `*text*` and under 
*Status*, click the *text* field. 
.. In the *Target* search field, enter `*description*` and then click the
Salesforce *Description* field to create the mapping. 
.. In the upper right, click 
the grid icon image:images/grid.png[title="Grid"] to
display the list of mappings, which should look like this:
