The content is organized as follows:

* <<understanding>>
* <<logging-in-and-out>>
* <<connecting-to-applications>>
* <<adding-customizations>>
* <<creating-integrations>>
* <<managing-integrations>>

To learn how to use {prodname} by creating sample integrations, see the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/7.0-tp/html-single/fuse_ignite_sample_integration_tutorials/[Sample Integration Tutorials].

In this Technology Preview, consider the names Red Hat Fuse Online and
