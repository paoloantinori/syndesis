= Adding steps to operate on integration data

After you add connections to an integration, you can optionally add
steps between connections. A step operates on data obtained from the
previous connection or step and makes it available to the next
connection or step in the integration. 

Add all connections to your integration before you add any steps. 

In an integration, steps are optional. Add them if you need them. 
An integration can have any number of steps and steps can be
consecutive.
