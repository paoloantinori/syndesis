want the integration to use after the start connection and before 
the finish connection. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, select one of the following actions: 
+
* *Publish Messages* to send messages to the JMS destination you specify.
For details about configuring this action, see <<adding-amq-connection-finish>>.
* *Request Response Using Messages* to send messages to the JMS destination
you specify and receive a response. 
* *Subscribe to Messages* to receive messages from the JMS destination
you specify. For details about configuring this action, see
<<adding-amq-connection-start>>.

. Configure the action you selected. To configure 
the *Request Response Using Messages* action:
