= Creating API client connectors

To create an API client connector, do one of the following:

* Upload a Swagger 2.0 specification.
* Provide a URL for a Swagger 2.0 specification.

The Swagger specification describes an API that you want to connect to.  
{prodname} verifies that the Swagger specification is valid and contains 
the information required to create the connector. {prodname} provides 
information if there is invalid or missing content. 

To create an API client connector:

. In the {prodname} navigation pane, click *Customizations* to display
the *API Client Connectors* tab. Any API client connectors that are
already available are listed here. 
. Click *Create API Connector*. 
. On the *Create API Client Connector* page, indicate whether you want
to upload a Swagger file or specify a URL for a Swagger specification. 
. Specify a Swagger file to upload or specify a URL for a Swagger 
specification. 
. Click *Next*. If there is invalid or missing content, {prodname} 
displays information about what needs to be corrected. Select a different 
Swagger file to upload or click *Cancel*,
revise the Swagger file, and upload the updated file. 
+
If the specification is valid and complete, {prodname} displays a summary of 
the actions that the connector will provide. This might include errors and 
warnings about the action specifications. To revise the Swagger file, 
click *Cancel*, revise the Swagger file, and upload the updated file. 
+
If you are satisfied with the action summary, click *Next*.
. Indicate the API's security requirements by selecting one of the 
following:
.. *No Security* 
.. *HTTP Basic Authorization* -- Enter the username and password you 
want to use to access the API. 
.. *OAuth* -- {prodname} prompts you to enter:
... *Authorization URL* is the location for registering {prodname} as
a client of the API. Registration authorizes {prodname} to access the API.
See <<register-with-rest-api>>. The Swagger specification or other 
documentation for the API should specify this URL. If it does not then 
you must contact the service provider to obtain this URL. 
... *Access Token URL* is required for OAuth authorization. Again, the
Swagger specification or other documentation for the API should provide 
this URL. If it does not then you must contact the service provider. 
. Click *Next*. {prodname} displays the connector's name, 
description, host, and base URL as indicated by the Swagger file. 
For connections that you create from this connector, 
+
** {prodname} 
concatenates the host and base URL values to define the endpoint for
the connection. For example, if the host is `https://example.com` and
the base URL is `/api/v1` then the connection endpoint is
`https://example.com/api/v1`.
** (prodname) applies  the schema specified in the Swagger file to data 
mapping steps. If the Swagger file supports more than one schema then {prodname} 
uses the TLS (HTTPS) schema. 
. Review the connector details and optionally upload an icon for the connector.
To override a value obtained from
the Swagger file, edit the field value that you want to change. 
After {prodname} creates a connector, 
you cannot change it. To effect a change, you need to upload an updated
Swagger file so that {prodname} can create a new connector. 
. When you are satisfied with the connector details, click *Create API Connector*. 

For details about using your new API connector in an integration, see 
<<connecting-to-rest-apis>>.
