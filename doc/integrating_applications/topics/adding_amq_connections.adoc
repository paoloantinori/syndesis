= Adding an AMQ connection to an integration

You must create an AMQ connection before you can add an
AMQ connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQ connection, 
see <<create-amq-connection>>. 

In this release, connections to AMQ are shapeless. That is, they do not 
define input/output types. Consequently, while AMQ connections can route 
messages to and from queues and topics, an integration cannot have a data 
mapper step before or after an AMQ connection, This limitation is expected 
to be removed in a future release. 

The procedure for adding an AMQ connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding an AMQ connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
